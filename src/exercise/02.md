# Intro to raw React APIs

## 📝 Your Notes\*

### Imperative vs. Declarative

Another less-spoken-of benefit to declarative code is that your program can be
context-independent. This means that because your code is concerned with what
the ultimate goal is— rather than the steps it takes to accomplish that goal —
the same code can be used in different programs, and work just fine. [...] by
definition, imperative code relies on the context of the current state.

One thing that I didn’t go too far into is how functional programming is a
subset of declarative programming. If you haven’t already, I highly recommend
getting more familiar with functional programming techniques in JavaScript.
Start with .map, .reduce, .filter and work your way up from there. Odds are
there isn’t a lower hanging fruit to improve your codebase than making it more
functional.

### Raw React APIs

The difference between React and ReactDOM is React will allow you to create
elements, which is what we use most of the time.

You create React elements very similar to how you create DOM elements, except
React elements are very simple objects that describe the UI that you want to
create. You take that UI, and you render it to the page using ReactDOM.

The reason that these two things are separate is because React supports other
platforms as well. You have React Native and React VR. You can use the core
React to create React elements for any of these platforms. Then you use the
platform-specific package to get those React elements into the environment where
you're shipping them to, whether that's native or DOM.

## Background

React is the most widely used frontend framework in the world and 👉it's using
the same APIs that you're using when it creates DOM nodes.

👉React abstracts away the imperative browser API from you to give you a much
more declarative API to work with.

One important thing to know about React is that it supports multiple platforms
(for example, native and web). Each of these platforms has its own code
necessary for interacting with that platform, and then there's shared code
between the platforms.

With that in mind, you need two JavaScript files to write React applications for
the web:

- React: responsible for creating React elements (kinda like
  `document.createElement()`)
- ReactDOM: responsible for rendering React elements to the DOM (kinda like
  `rootElement.append()`)

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/02.html)
- [Final](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/02.html)

Let's convert this to use React! But don't worry, we won't be doing any JSX just
yet... You're going to use raw React APIs here.

In modern applications you'll get React and React DOM files from a "package
registry" like [npm](https://npmjs.com) ([react](https://npm.im/react) and
[react-dom](https://npm.im/react-dom)). But for these first exercises, we'll use
the script files which are available on [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com) and
regular script tags so you don't have to bother installing them. So in the
exercise you'll be required to add script tags for these files.

Once you include the script tags, you'll have two new global variables to use:
`React` and `ReactDOM`.

Here's a simple example of the API:

```javascript
const elementProps = {id: 'element-id', children: 'Hello world!'}
const elementType = 'h1'
const reactElement = React.createElement(elementType, elementProps)
ReactDOM.render(reactElement, rootElement)
```

Alright! Let's do this!

See if you can figure out how to write the JavaScript + React code to generate
this DOM output:

```html
<body>
  <div id="root">
    <div class="container">
      <span>Hello</span>
      <span>World</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```

Elaborate on what you learned:

Imperative and declarative code: In my own words, imperative code is gradual,
slow, and explanatory, while declarative code is implicit, inherit, and
meaningful – I personally prefer declarative code.

React uses the same APIs that the DOM uses to create nodes, but React abstracts
the browser API to give a much more declarative API to work with. With this in
mind, we need two JS files to write React apps: React, for creating React
elements; and ReactDOM, for rendering them to the DOM. – The reason they are
separated is because React supports other platforms as well. E.g. React Native,
React VR. In those you can use the core React to create React elements, but
instead of the ReactDOM you use the platform-specific package.
