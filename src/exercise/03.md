# Using JSX

## 📝 Your Notes\*

FYI: The create-react-app package largely handles this using Babel and Webpack.
Babel is a JS library that converts JSX and the likes of ES6 and ES7 into plain
JavaScript, while Webpack is a web bundler that takes all of your files and
brings them together into one build.

Fortunately for us, create-react-app already comes with Babel and Webpack both
installed and configured. Installing and configured Babel and Webpack can be a
chore all on their own.

💰 there are a few subtle differences between JSX and HTML. One such difference
is how you apply a class to an element in JSX is by using `className` rather
than `class`! 📜 You can learn the differences between JSX and HTML syntax from
the React docs
[here](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#differences-in-attributes).

JSX is not JS, but a different thing, so we need to have something stand between
the code that we write and the code that runs in the browser. The code that we
write is going to be the JSX, and the code that runs in the browser is going to
be React Create Element Calls.

That's what Babel is. Because Babel is written in JavaScript, we can have it run
in the browser, which is mind-blowingly awesome. It is absolutely not something
that you will actually do in your production applications. You're definitely
going to want to pre-compile it and then send the compiled version to the
browser.

### Spread Operator in JSX

If you have an object of props, and you want to apply them to a particular
element, then the way that you accomplish that is using a spread syntax that's
very similar to object spread, which is implemented in JavaScript. This is the
JSX version of that same spread syntax. Then, of course, the order does matter,
and it matters in the same way that the object spread syntax matters as well.

## Background

JSX is more intuitive than the raw React API and is easier to understand when
reading the code. 👉👉It's fairly simple HTML-like syntactic sugar on top of the
raw React APIs:

```jsx
const ui = <h1 id="greeting">Hey there</h1>

// ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ compiles to ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓

const ui = React.createElement('h1', {id: 'greeting', children: 'Hey there'})
```

👉Because JSX is not actually JavaScript, you have to convert it using something
called a code compiler. [Babel](https://babeljs.io) is one such tool.

🦉 Pro tip: If you'd like to see how JSX gets compiled to JavaScript,
[check out the online babel REPL here](https://babeljs.io/repl#?builtIns=App&code_lz=MYewdgzgLgBArgSxgXhgHgCYIG4D40QAOAhmLgBICmANtSGgPRGm7rNkDqIATtRo-3wMseAFBA&presets=react&prettier=true).

👉👉If you can train your brain to look at JSX and see the compiled version of
that code, you'll be MUCH more effective at reading and using it! I strongly
recommend you give this some intentional practice.

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/03.html)
- [Final](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.html)

Normally you'll compile all of your code at build-time before you ship your
application to the browser, but because Babel is written in JavaScript we can
actually run it _in_ the browser to compile our code on the fly and that's what
we'll do in this exercise.

So we'll include a script tag for Babel, then we'll update our own script tag to
tell Babel to compile it for us on the fly. When you're done, you should notice
the compiled version of the code appears in the `<head>` of the DOM (which you
can inspect using DevTools).

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 interpolate className and children

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.extra-1.html)

"Interpolation" is defined as "the insertion of something of a different nature
into something else."

Let's take template literals for example:

```javascript
const greeting = 'Sup'
const subject = 'World'
const message = `${greeting} ${subject}`
```

See if you can figure out how to extract the `className` (`"container"`) and
`children` (`"Hello World"`) to variables and interpolate them in the JSX.

```jsx
const className = 'container'
const children = 'Hello World'
const element = <div className="hmmm">how do I make this work?</div>
```

📜 The react docs for JSX are pretty good:
https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html

Here are a few sections of particular interest for this extra credit:

- https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#embedding-expressions-in-jsx
- https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#specifying-attributes-with-jsx

### 2. 💯 spread props

[Production deploy](http://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/isolated/final/03.extra-2.html)

What if I have an object of props that I want applied to the `div` like this:

```jsx
const children = 'Hello World'
const className = 'container'
const props = {children, className}
const element = <div /> // how do I apply props to this div?
```

If we were doing raw React APIs it would be:

```jsx
const element = React.createElement('div', props)
```

Or, it could be written like this:

```jsx
const element = React.createElement('div', {...props})
```

See if you can figure out how to make that work with JSX.
